Once upon a very Tuesday afternoon, Sir Goofington the Third woke up inside his refrigerator. No one knew how he got there, not even him. He stepped out, grabbed a single grape for courage, and declared:

“Behold! I shall find out who keeps stealing my left socks!”

With heroic determination (and exactly one functioning brain cell), he marched outside—only to trip over an angry squirrel wearing one of his socks. The squirrel stared at him like he owed rent.

Sir Goofington gasped. “You… you sock bandit!”

The squirrel squeaked menacingly, performed a backflip for intimidation, and ran off into the sunset wearing the sock like a tiny superhero cape.

Sir Goofington knew this was only the beginning. And so, with one bare foot and one confused foot, he set off on the greatest quest of his moderately weird life
